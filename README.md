- The [Fulcrum Keyboard](https://github.com/dschil138/Fulcrum) is my most recent project. It drastically improves the ergonomics and functionality of computer keyboards

- The [Room Temperature Circuit Sculpure](https://github.com/dschil138/circuit-sculpture-room-temp) combines form and function

- My day job is helping companies grow at [Cradle Media](https://cradle.media)
